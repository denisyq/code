#python note
#------------
1. python2.7 source code is located /usr/lib/python2.7
2. python bin is located /usr/bin/python, use "ln -s /usr/bin/python3.2 python"
3. Download new version 3.5 in /usr/local/bin, make link "sudo ln -s python3 python". If same python exists in /usr/bin which directs python2, could make /usr/local/bin priority to /usr/bin by modify $PATH.
4. Some other suggestion said, not add "#! /usr/bin/python" in each python file. User python3.5 a.py or python2.7 a.py to run a.py.
5. pip depends on different version of python, which means every python has its pip. pip2.7 install requests, could not be used in python3.5. Run "pip2.7 list" or "pip3.5 list"
